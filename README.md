# fitness-app

Project Description
During our Ultimate UX Design project, we walked in the shoes of a designer and a developer to create a fitness app. Once handed the design, we approached the project by developing the mobile version first. Once we had that complete, we moved on to developing the desktop version. We quickly realized that not much of the mobile version was usable in the desktop version. We approached this by creating an ipad version of the desktop version so that we had something to work with that could be responsive. In the end, we used one file to create all three versions and displayed them depending on the screen size.

The target user for this fitness app are endurance athletes, such as triathletes. We wanted to make the mobile app something the user could quickly open up and begin working out and have options for moving around the app to see more details if they wanted.
The desktop was more focused on showing the overall stats and being able to jump through your days to analyze your historical data. Also added in more features and a friend aspect to help leverage the competitive nature of the user.
