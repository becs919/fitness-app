The target user for this fitness app are endurance athletes, such as triathletes. We wanted to make the mobile app something the user could quickly open up and begin working out and have options for moving around the app to see more details if they wanted.
The desktop was more focused on showing the overall stats and being able to jump through your days to analyze your historical data. Also added in more features and a friend aspect to help leverage the competitive nature of the user.
